Congratulations! You've reached the end. Over the course of this book, we've
learned how testing can be used to ensure the correctness of your code, how to
use tools to automate your tests, and how to integrate them with Rails.

We've also explored how techniques such as **TDD** and **Outside-in testing**,
can improve not only your tests but also the implementation of your source code.
However, poorly written tests can have the opposite effect so we've discussed
various pitfalls and anti-patterns to avoid. Finally, we've taken a look at
first principles and how coupling among the objects in a system impacts the
tests.

You have the tools to write an effective test suite that documents your code,
catches regressions, and gives you the confidence you need to keep moving. Take
advantage of this to tame your existing projects and tackle bigger, more
challenging project!
